 **NOTE**: This package may not be as appropriate for your own lab environment
 as it is for ours.  For the Shaka team, this package is primarily a documented,
 repeatable, and automated installation process for a critical asset in the lab.
 Use it in your own setup if you wish, but at your own risk.  If installed
 naively, this could conflict with existing services on your network.
