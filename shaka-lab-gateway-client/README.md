# Shaka Lab Gateway Client

The Shaka Lab Gateway Client package allows Active Directory users from Shaka
Lab Gateway to log in.

**NOTE**: Exactly one Linux device on your lab network must install the
[`shaka-lab-gateway`](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-lab/tree/main/shaka-lab-gateway#readme)
package.  Devices with the client package will connect to that gateway.

This package is available for:

 - [Linux](linux/README.md#readme)
 - [Windows](windows/README.md#readme)
 - [macOS](macos/README.md#readme)
