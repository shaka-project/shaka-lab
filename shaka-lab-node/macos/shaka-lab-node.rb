  # We _could_ depend on a Java formula directly, but that would involve
  # installing OpenJDK, including nonsense like X11 libraries (which Mac
  # doesn't use).
  #
  # What is preferable is to install Oracle's JDK as a binary, which is only
  # available in Homebrew as a "cask".  But a "formula" (this package) can't
  # depend on a "cask".  So instead, we have to inform the user if Java is
  # missing and recommend that they install the cask to solve it.
  #
  # We have to tell the user what to do to start the services because Homebrew
  # runs installation commands in a sandbox, so we can't start the service
  # automatically during installation.
